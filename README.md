musescore-fiddle-fingering
==========================

Plugin for Musescore that writes fingering for fiddle, violin or mandolin.

http://musescore.org/en/project/fiddlefingering

The plugin writes the fingering and the name of the string for all notes from G0 to E4. The fingering is written as text below the note.

It takes only the first voice in each staff.

The plugin is installed by putting the javascript-file in the plugin directory (normal plugin installation).
